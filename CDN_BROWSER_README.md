```bash
# BunnyCDN Configuration
BUNNY_ACCESS_KEY="your-bunnycdn-access-key-here"
BUNNY_STORAGE_ZONE="kolleris"
BUNNY_CDN_URL="https://cdn.bunny.net"
BUNNY_STORAGE_URL="https://kolleris.b-cdn.net"
```

### 2. Get Your BunnyCDN API Key

1. Log in to your BunnyCDN dashboard
2. Go to "Storage" ‚Üí "FTP & API Access"
3. Copy your API key
4. Add it to your environment variables

### 3. Storage Zone Configuration

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import CDNBrowser from '@/components/cdn-browser';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto py-8">
      <CDNBrowser />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom Path

The component automatically starts at the `kolleris/prismafiles/megaparking` folder and restricts access to only this folder and its subfolders. Users cannot navigate to parent directories for security reasons.

## API Endpoints

**Query Parameters:**
- `path` (optional): The folder path to browse (defaults to `prismafiles/megaparking`)

}
```

## Component Props

The `CDNBrowser` component doesn't accept any props and manages its own state internally.

## File Upload Component

The `FileUpload` component provides:

- Drag and drop file selection
- Multiple file upload support
- Progress tracking
- Error handling
- File management

### Props

```tsx
interface FileUploadProps {
  currentPath: string;           // Current CDN path
  onUploadComplete: () => void; // Callback when upload completes
  onClose: () => void;          // Callback to close the modal
}
```

## Customization

### Styling

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes and can be customized by modifying the className props or extending the component.

### Icons

Icons are from Lucide React. You can replace them with your preferred icon library.

### File Types

The component automatically detects file types and displays appropriate icons. You can extend this by adding custom file type handlers.

## Browser Support

- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 88+

## Performance Considerations

- Files are fetched on-demand when navigating folders
- Search is debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- File uploads use XMLHttpRequest for progress tracking
- Component uses React.memo and useCallback for optimization

## Security

- API keys are stored server-side only
- File uploads are validated on the server
- No sensitive information is exposed to the client
- **Access Restrictions**: Users can only browse and upload within the `kolleris/prismafiles/megaparking` folder
- **Server-side Validation**: API endpoints enforce folder access restrictions
- **Parent Directory Prevention**: Navigation above the restricted root is blocked

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Ensure your BunnyCDN API key is correct and has proper permissions
2. **Storage Zone Not Found**: Verify the storage zone name matches your configuration
3. **Upload Failures**: Check file size limits and storage zone permissions
4. **CORS Issues**: Ensure your CDN is configured to allow uploads from your domain

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking the browser console for detailed error messages.
